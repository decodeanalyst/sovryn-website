We are pleased to announce that we have teamed up with Liquality to bring you a new and seamless way to swap your crypto into RBTC, Sovryn’s native asset.
</br>
</br>

Now you can lend, borrow and margin trade using RBTC on our platform through your linked Liquality wallet that contains all the features you’ll ever need. There are of course still other options to choose from, but the Liquality wallet browser extension offers you a secure multi-crypto wallet with inbuilt atomic swaps, so what’s not to love?
</br>
</br>

<h1>Liquality - Top features of a top wallet</h1>
As Sovryn is built on the Bitcoin Layer 2 network, you will need to use a Web3 wallet that supports Rootstock (RSK). Liquality offers that functionality, enabling you to convert your BTC into RBTC for use on our trading, lending and borrowing platform.
</br>
</br>

Here are some of the key features of the Liquality wallet that has a fast growing community of over 3000 users:
</br>
</br>

<b>A secure multi-crypto wallet</b>
</br>
</br>

Liquality supports many different types of cryptos and can run on your browser as a secure extension. You can easily configure Liquality to run with Sovryn securely, right from your browser window.
</br>
</br>

Liquality supports a range of applications within your browser, including Bitcoin, Ethereum and Rootstock. As a MetaMask alternative, it supports multiple blockchains, allowing you to easily swap between BTC, ETH, ERC20s and RSK tokens, with inbuilt rapid atomic swaps.
</br>
</br>

<b>Built-in atomic swaps</b>
</br>
</br>

Atomic swaps are the easiest, safest and fastest way to swap crypto across blockchains. To date, Liquality has facilitated over $6 million in atomic swaps, making them a trustworthy partner for use on Sovryn.
</br>
</br>

<b>A multi-chain wallet</b>
</br>
</br>

Using Liquality, you can send, receive, swap, HODL, use dapps and much more all within a single interface. Liquality supports a range of tokens including BTC, ETH, ERC20s and the RSK network for all these transactions.
</br>
</br>

<b>Non-custodial and secure</b>
</br>
</br>

As a non-custodial wallet, you remain in total control of your assets. As a sole owner your assets are completely secure, as you alone have access to your private key.
</br>
</br>

<b>No hassles of registration or KYC</b>
</br>
</br>

Registering a new wallet can be a pain at times. Many centralized exchanges take this a step further and mandate the customer to complete KYC (Know Your Customer) verification check. This can be both time consuming, frustrating and an infringement on your privacy.
</br>
</br>

Liquality, however, is hassle free as it supports easy importing and exporting of your pre-existing mnemonic seed phrase, combining it with a password which you need to set. In almost no time, you’re ready to link and use your newly created Liquality wallet with Sovryn, with absolutely no KYC required.
