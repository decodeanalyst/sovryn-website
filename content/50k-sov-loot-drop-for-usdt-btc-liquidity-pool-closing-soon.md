Attention Sovryn and Bitcoin mutants! The 50K loot drop for the USDT/BTC liquidity pool will close on Saturday 1st May, at 12:00 UTC.

We would like to take this opportunity to give a big shout out to all Sovryn liquidity providers who have committed their crypto to this pool. Your contribution either as BTC or USDT has helped evolve the Sovryn trading monster.

The longer you have kept funds in the pool the more SOV you will be eligible for. To check your rewards, simply enter your wallet address in our Rewards Calculator. You will be able to view your Loot Drop % along with the SOV and USD equivalent at the time of query. This calculation does not include fees you earn in the pool, nor does it show the total value of the pool in the AMM.

Rewards are split evenly between both the USDT and BTC pools, 25K SOV for each. We anticipate that rewards will be deposited directly into your wallet by the end of next week. Please note that these rewards will be auto staked in Bitocracy for a period of 10 months, and 1/10th will unstake every month.

Once you have collected rewards from this pool, donâ€™t forget that there is still time to flip to the SOV/BTC liquidity mining pool where an additional 75K loot drop closes on Tuesday 11th May.

If you wish to add more funds to the system, our FastBTC feature lets you quickly convert BTC into rBTC with just a few clicks.

We hope you will continue to take advantage of the many promotions, new and ongoing during this launch period. Sovryn is the DeFi for Bitcoin platform and we are just getting started. Join us and Stay Sovryn!
