Greetings Sovryn mutants! Get ready to exercise your voting freedom as we head towards SIP 18. In this SIP active Sovryn community member Dark Knight proposes to provide deep stablecoin liquidity to Sovryn through [BabelFish](https://babelfish.money/), the stablecoin aggregator.

BabelFish acts as a decentralized bank having branches on different chains, accepting and distributing USD-pegged coins. This will provide enhanced liquidity to whatever system it gets integrated into. The underlying idea is to launch a decentralized protocol by means of a private token sale to the committed members of Sovryn. DYOR and check out the discussion around Babelfish on our [Forum here](https://forum.sovryn.app/t/drafting-a-sip-for-babelfish/734).
