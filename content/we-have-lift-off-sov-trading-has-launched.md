The SOV token is now publicly tradable, exclusively on the Sovryn platform. We are also thrilled to announce the launch of the SOV/BTC liquidity pool. As we lift our whitelist and open our doors to all, we mark the start of a new era of finance where all can participate indiscriminately.

To celebrate this moment we are launching our biggest loot drop yet. 75,000 SOV tokens are up for grabs to users that deposit to the SOV/BTC pool. Rewards will be issued in proportion to the amount of crypto deposited and the number of days held in the pool. **The offer will run from April 13th for 4 weeks, with double rewards for the first week**. The sooner you enter the more SOV you can earn. Adding liquidity to the pool is straightforward. Check out our guide to get involved.

If you donâ€™t have crypto in the Sovryn system yet, try out our FastBTC feature that lets you quickly convert BTC into rBTC with just a few clicks. Alternatively, check out the fiat on-ramp provided by our partner Transak.

We hope you will take advantage of this launch period. Sovryn is the DeFi for Bitcoin platform and we are just getting started. Join us and Stay Sovryn!
